        <p class="description">
          The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that are
          premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It will say on each
          challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to tell the
          difference.

          Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your
          portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking projects to
          their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!

        <p class="description">
          The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
          Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so
          it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help"
          channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our
          Discord server.
